This repository is created for the course ***Algorithm and Discrete Mathematics*** in FISE A1S1.

All code for the creation of my AI will be showed in thie repository after the final test of this course.

Talk is cheap! I will show you my code.

+ **Lab1**: Program a rat that moves randomly while avoiding walls

  + Question found: 
    + In the project PyRat, a file named *random.py* which may cause problems in importing library *numpy*
  + Skilled learned:
    + Meet library *numpy*
  + Lessons:
